# Telecom-Churn-Analysis-using-Python-NumPy-Pandas-

Performed EDA on a telecom churn dataset using Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas) to uncover factors influencing customer attrition. Key findings included:
Significantly higher churn rate among customers with international plans.
Strong correlation between high customer service call volume (>3) and churn, particularly for international plan users.

Developed a rule-based baseline model achieving 85.8% accuracy (International Plan & Customer Service Calls > 3 => Churn), exceeding the naive baseline (predicting all customers as loyal) of 85.5%. This baseline served as a benchmark for subsequent machine learning model development.
